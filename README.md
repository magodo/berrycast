UI inspired by [this](https://github.com/matthew-carroll/flutter_ui_challenge_music_player) flutter ui challenge project, thank you Matthew.Carrol, and your awsome [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FE7Vtzq52xg) 🎉

The internal implementation is different, including

- Use [audioplayers](https://pub.dev/packages/audioplayers) instead of [fluttery_audio](https://pub.dev/packages/fluttery_audio)
- Use [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) for state management
